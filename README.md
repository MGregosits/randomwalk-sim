## Introduction
This project is designed to simulate random walks, a mathematical concept that describes a path consisting of a succession of random steps. The project is capable of simulating both classical and quantum random walks. It uses a Flask backend to handle the simulations and a React JS frontend to display the results.

## Features
- Simulate random walks with customizable parameters
- Visualize random walk paths and statistics
- Responsive user interface

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** Node.js, React JS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.11)
- Node.js (>=21.x)
- npm (>=10.x)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MGregosits/randomwalk-sim.git
   cd randomwalk-sim

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install .

3. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install .

### Running the application
1. Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   flask run

2. Run the React frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

### Usage
Once the application is running, you can configure the parameters of the random walk simulation through the web interface and visualize the results.
